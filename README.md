This file is a wrapper for executing functions contained in the lpo and gpx packages. It is considered useful
during internal development and testing, but is not intended for other users. It is assumed that any user
wishing to incorporate lpo and/or gpx in their software will have their own code for using the functions that
have been provided in those packages.
